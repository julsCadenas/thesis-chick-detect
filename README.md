# ChickSense: Heat Stress Monitoring and Management for Poultry

This repository contains the code for our thesis project, which focuses on chicken object detection and thermal imaging to monitor heat stress in poultry. It also includes the models we trained with our dataset.

```main.py ``` - for training the model.

```distance.py``` - utilizes camera + object detection and distance calculation.

```video.py``` - tests the model on videos.

```webcam.py``` - tests the model using your webcam or any external camera

```/stream/stream.py``` - Draft code for streaming the video output of object detection to a website.

```/colab/chicktraining_colab_version.ipynb``` - notebook version for training and testing on a video.
